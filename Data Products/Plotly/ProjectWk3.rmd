```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Scatterplot

Below is a scatterplot of a variable y which depends linearly on a variable x along with some added normally distributed error terms:

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(plotly)
set.seed(153)
x = 1:100
eps <- rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 5)
y = x + eps
plot_ly(x=x, y=y, mode = "markers")
```

## Histogram

Now we look at a histogram of the added error terms:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot_ly(x = eps, type = "histogram")
```


## Thank You
