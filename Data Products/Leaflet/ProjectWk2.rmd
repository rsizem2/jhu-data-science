```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(leaflet)
```
In this document we demonstrate a very basic use of the Leaflet app by generating random markers on a map which are then automatically clustered based on the scale with which the user is viewing the map.

## Map of Baton Rouge Area

We populate the map with markers where the latitude lies in $(30.35,30.45)$ and the longitude lies in $(-91.25,-91.15)$, which corresponds to the area around Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

```{r}
set.seed(153)
df <- data.frame(lat = runif(500, min = 30.35, max = 30.45),
                 lng = runif(500, min = -91.25, max = -91.15))
df %>% 
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
```
