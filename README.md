# README
All of my submitted coursework from the JHU Data Science specialization sequence on Coursera done between June 2019 and January 2020. I wanted to put all of this under one repository to clean up my GitHub a bit.

# Courses

* R Programming - final project for 'R Programming', the 2nd course in the sequence. Created R code for computing and caching various vector/matrix operations.
* Data Cleaning - final project for 'Cleaning Data', the 3rd course in the sequence. R script which cleans and labels an untidy dataset in preparation for subsequence analyses.
* Exploratory Analysis - final project for 'Exploratory Analysis', the 4th course in the sequence. R scripts for plotting data to be used in an initial exploratory analysis of the given dataset.
* Reproducible Research - final project for 'Reproducible Research', the 5th course in the sequence. Includes a reproducible analysis of data collected from a fitness tracking smart device.
* Machine Learning - final project for 'Machine Learning', the 8th course in the sequence. Code for determining the exercise movement performed based on various features recorded via sensors.
* Capstone Project - final project for the JHU Data Science specialization. We build a n-gram model based text prediction application using a corpus of text from news, blogs and twitter sources.
